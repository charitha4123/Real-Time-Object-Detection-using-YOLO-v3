# Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-YOLO-v3

**Project:**

Real-Time Object Detection with YOLO
This project implements real-time object detection using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm, a fast and efficient deep learning approach for computer vision tasks.

**Key Features:**

_Real-Time Processing:_
Analyzes video streams or camera feeds at high frame rates, enabling applications in autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and more.

_YOLO Algorithm:_
Leverages the power of YOLO to efficiently predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects within images or frames.

_Customizable/Pre-Trained Model:_
Choose one depending on your implementation:
_Customizable Model:_
Train a YOLO model on your own dataset to detect specific objects relevant to your use case.

_Pre-Trained Model:_
Utilize a pre-trained YOLO model for quicker setup and object classes it's already trained for.

**Getting Started:**

_Prerequisites:_
Ensure you have Python, necessary deep learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch,tkinter), and OpenCV installed.

_Train model(optional):_
If using a customizable model, follow the instructions within the project to train it on your dataset.

_Run Inference:_
Execute the provided file (run.bat) to launch the real-time object detection application. The script will typically accept arguments to specify the video source (webcam) and the YOLO model to use.

**Applications:**

This project's real-time object detection capabilities can be applied to various domains, including:

_Autonomous Vehicles:_
Detect pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs for safe navigation.

_Surveillance Systems:_
Identify objects of interest in video streams for security monitoring.

_Interactive Systems:_
Develop applications with real-time object recognition for augmented reality or human-computer interaction.

**Disclaimer:**

The specific instructions and considerations for training, customization, and optimization may vary depending on the chosen YOLO version and your project's implementation details. Refer to the provided code documentation within the repository for more tailored guidance.
